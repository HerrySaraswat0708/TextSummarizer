# Custom Text Summarization Model

This repository contains a custom text summarization model built using an encoder-decoder architecture. The model is trained on a CNN/Daily Mail dataset and is capable of generating concise summaries for given input texts.

## Overview

Text summarization is the process of distilling the key information from a piece of text and presenting it in a concise form. The model in this repository utilizes a custom encoder-decoder architecture to perform abstractive summarization, generating summaries that capture the essence of the input text.

## Architecture

The custom text summarization model is built using an encoder-decoder architecture specifically designed for the task. The encoder component takes the input text and processes it to create a representation that captures the relevant information. The decoder component then generates the summary based on the encoded representation.

While the specific architecture may vary based on your implementation, the general idea behind the encoder-decoder model is to leverage the encoding phase to extract useful features from the input text and decode those features into a concise summary. This approach allows the model to understand the semantics of the input text and produce meaningful summaries.

## Training

The model is trained using a large dataset of paired input texts and corresponding summaries. The training process involves optimizing the model's parameters to minimize the difference between the generated summaries and the reference summaries. You can experiment with various training strategies such as gradient descent optimization and sequence-to-sequence modeling to improve the model's performance.

During training, the model learns to generalize from the training examples and can summarize a wide range of input texts. However, it's important to note that the quality of the generated summaries may vary depending on the complexity and diversity of the input texts.

## Usage

To use the custom text summarization model, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/custom-text-summarization-model.git
2. Install the required dependencies. You can specify the dependencies and their versions in a `requirements.txt` file or provide installation instructions specific to your model.

3. Load the trained model weights. If you have pre-trained weights, make sure to include instructions on how to load them into the model.

4. Use the model's API or command-line interface to generate summaries for your input texts.

The model should offer an interface that allows users to input text and receive generated summaries as output. Ensure that the instructions are clear and concise, enabling users to utilize the model effectively.
