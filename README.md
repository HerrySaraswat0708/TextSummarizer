# Text Summarization Model

![Text Summarization Model Demo](demo.gif)

This repository contains a text summarization model built using an encoder-decoder architecture. The model is trained on a large dataset and is capable of generating concise summaries for given input texts.

## Overview

Text summarization is the process of distilling the key information from a piece of text and presenting it in a concise form. The model in this repository is designed to perform abstractive summarization, where it generates summaries by understanding the meaning of the input text and expressing it in a human-like manner.

## Architecture

The text summarization model is built using an encoder-decoder architecture, specifically the Transformer model. The encoder takes the input text and processes it to create a rich representation of the input sequence. The decoder then generates the summary based on the encoded representation.

The Transformer model is known for its effectiveness in capturing long-range dependencies and handling sequential data. It utilizes self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different words in the input text, allowing the model to focus on the most relevant information for summarization.

## Training

The model is trained using a large dataset of paired input texts and corresponding summaries. The training process involves optimizing the model's parameters to minimize the difference between the generated summaries and the reference summaries. The model is trained using techniques such as teacher forcing and beam search to improve its performance.

During training, the model learns to generalize from the training examples and can summarize a wide range of input texts. However, it's important to note that the quality of the generated summaries may vary depending on the complexity and diversity of the input texts.

## Usage

To use the text summarization model, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-summarization-model.git
2. Install the required dependencies. You can use pip to install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Load the trained model weights. You can either train the model from scratch using your own dataset or download pre-trained weights from the model's release page.

4. Use the model's API or command-line interface to generate summaries for your input texts. You can find examples and instructions in the `examples` directory.

The model provides a convenient API for generating summaries programmatically. You can also use the provided command-line interface to interact with the model and generate summaries from the command line.

## Examples

To help you get started, we have provided some example code in the `examples` directory. These examples demonstrate how to use the model to generate summaries for different types of input texts. You can run the examples directly or modify them according to your requirements.

The examples cover various scenarios, including summarizing news articles, blog posts, and scientific papers. They showcase the model's ability to generate coherent and informative summaries across different domains.

Feel free to explore and experiment with the examples to get a better understanding of the model's capabilities.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the quality of the model's summaries, we provide evaluation metrics such as ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation). ROUGE measures the overlap between the generated summaries and reference summaries, giving you an idea of the summarization quality.

We encourage you to evaluate the model on your own dataset or use publicly available benchmark datasets to compare its performance with other text summarization models.
